Lungs: Status post right upper lobectomy. There is unchanged opacity in the right mid to lower lung. Left lung is clear.
 
Pleura: There is unchanged small right pleural effusion. There is decreased right apical pneumothorax 3.2 cm compared to 4.2 cm. There is suspected right basilar pneumothorax.
 
Heart/Mediastinum: Unchanged in appearance.
 
Bones/Soft Tissues: Postsurgical changes of right thoracotomy. There is decreased subcutaneous emphysema.

Slightly decreased right apical pneumothorax. Suspected new right basilar pneumothorax.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
 
Expiratory chest radiograph to further assess pneumothorax.

Pneumothorax
Narrative:
XR CHEST PORTABLE
 
COMPARISON: XR CHEST PORTABLE 2023-Mar-xx
 
FINDINGS:
 
Devices/Tubes/Lines: The tip of the right PICC line is in the SVC. The tip of the tracheostomy tube lies 3 cm from the top of the carina. There is a 6 mm RIGHT apical pneumothorax
 
Lungs: There is continuing perihilar airspace opacity likely to represent pulmonary edema. There is atelectasis in the LEFT lower lobe. There is multifocal consolidation in the LEFT mid and lower zone concerning for superimposed pneumonia or aspiration
 
Pleura: There is a 6 mm RIGHT apical pneumothorax
 
Heart/Mediastinum: The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are stable.
 
Bones/Soft Tissues: There are mild degenerative changes within the thoracic spine.
 


IMPRESSION:
 6 cm RIGHT apical pneumothorax.
 
Continuing pulmonary edema, LEFT lung pneumonia and LEFT basal atelectasis.

ADDENDUM:
 ADDENDUM:     There is a voice recognition error in the impression of the report that states:  6 cm RIGHT apical pneumothorax.  This should read:  6 mm stable RIGHT apical pneumothorax."
